# Task: Integrate Custom Age Range Slider with Onboarding Store

**Date:** 2025-08-15

## Objective

- Integrate a custom range slider component for age preferences in the onboarding flow.
- Connect the slider to the onboarding store, so min/max age preferences are persisted and updated.
- Fix gesture error by ensuring the app is wrapped in `GestureHandlerRootView`.

## Action Plan

1. Diagnose and resolve the `PanGestureHandler` error by wrapping the app root in `GestureHandlerRootView`.
2. Review the onboarding store to confirm it manages `minAgePreference` and `maxAgePreference`.
3. Update the onboarding screen to:
   - Use the store for slider value and onChange.
   - Pass min/max props to the slider for clarity.
4. Ensure the slider component is compatible and receives correct props.
5. Document all changes in the project documentation.

## Files Modified

- `app/_layout.tsx`  
  *Wrapped root in `GestureHandlerRootView` to enable gesture support for sliders and similar components.*

- `app/onboarding/basicinfo.tsx`  
  *Connected `CustomInputRangeSlider` to onboarding store for age preferences. Now uses `minAgePreference` and `maxAgePreference` from the store, and updates them on change.*

## Observations

- The onboarding store already had the necessary state and actions for age preferences.
- The slider component supports min/max/value/onChange and works as expected after the root fix.
- No changes to the store or slider component were required beyond usage.
- Documentation and devlog updated as per project guidelines.
